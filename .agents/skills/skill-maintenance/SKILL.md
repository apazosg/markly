description: >
  Audits, reconciles, and maintains the agent documentation ecosystem:
  skills, references/, and agents.md. Use this skill whenever the user asks to review
  or update a skill, detect duplicated content between skills and references/, check
  if a skill section references deleted or refactored code, move cross-cutting
  principles to agents.md, align the references/ folder with the current skill set,
  or verify that the knowledge structure enables subagent self-loading.
  Also use when the user says "la skill está desactualizada", "hay duplicados",
  "refactoriza la documentación del agente", "sanea el agents.md", "audita las skills",
  "hay código que ya no existe en la skill", or "limpia la documentación de agentes".
  NEVER skip the planning phase — always produce an approved plan before making changes.
  Also use when the user wants to CREATE a new skill: "crea una skill para", "necesito una skill",
  "escribe una skill", "añade una skill", "documenta este patrón como skill".

# Skill Maintenance

## Purpose

Guide an AI agent to audit, reconcile, and maintain the agent documentation
ecosystem so it stays consistent, non-redundant, and aligned with the project.

The overarching goal of this ecosystem is **subagent self-loading**: a parent agent
assigns a task to a subagent, the subagent reads `agents.md`, and from that single file
it can determine exactly what to load next — without the parent injecting context. Every
audit must verify this property is preserved.

---

## Knowledge Taxonomy

Before auditing or creating a skill, internalise this classification. Every piece of content
belongs in exactly one place.

| Content type | Canonical location | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-cutting agent behavior (no sycophancy, calibrate uncertainty, etc.) | `agents.md` — `Agent Behavior` section | Always loaded; applies to every task and every subagent |
| Project orientation: architecture, guardrails, spec index, load rules | `agents.md` | Always loaded; gives any subagent its bearings |
| Operational knowledge: build, test, branching — too small for a skill | `.agents/references/*.md` | Lazy-loaded on demand via Context Loading Rules |
| Domain implementation guide: rich enough for ✅/❌ examples + checklist | `.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | Auto-triggered by skill `description` |

**Decision heuristic for new content:**
- Applies to every task regardless of domain → `agents.md`.
- Operational, < ~2 pages, no workflow needed → `references/`.
- Domain-specific, warrants a workflow + examples + checklist → new or existing skill.

---

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

When the same subject appears in multiple files, the higher priority wins.

| Priority | Location |
|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | `.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` — canonical implementation guide for its domain |
| 2 | `agents.md` — global rules and routing |
| 3 | `.agents/references/*.md` — operational details with no owning skill |

When content at priority 3 is fully covered by a skill, delete it from the reference
file. Move any unique information into the skill first, then delete.

---

> **Auditing mode** — Use the sections below to audit and reconcile an existing ecosystem.

## Workflow

### Phase A — Audit + Plan

1. Read `agents.md` fully.
2. List all files under `.agents/skills/` and `.agents/references/`.
3. For each skill, read its frontmatter and skim section headers.
4. For each `references/` file, identify its subject and check taxonomy fit.
5. Check `agents.md` for content that belongs in a skill or should be removed.
6. Detect inconsistencies (see §Inconsistency Types below).
7. Draft the plan file (see §Plan Document Format).

**STOP. Write the plan file to disk. Do not change any file until the user approves.**

### Phase B — Reconcile

1. Re-read the plan from disk.
2. Execute in plan order. Check each item off after completion.
3. If execution reveals new information affecting other items, **STOP**, add to
   `## Open Issues`, and surface to the user.
4. After all items are done, set `state: done` in the plan frontmatter.

---

## Plan Document Format

Use `skill-audit` as the topic (or `skill-audit-<component>` for scoped audits, e.g. `skill-audit-dotnet`).

| State | Path |
|---|---|
| Active | `.agents/planning/skill-audit-plan.md` |
| Completed | `.agents/planning/done/skill-audit-plan.md` |

Required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: skill-audit-YYYY-MM-DD
state: draft   # draft | approved | in-progress | done
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

For the full plan body format (required sections, structure, examples), load the `task-planning` skill.

---

## Inconsistency Types

### Type 1 — Duplication between `references/` and a skill

A reference file covers a domain already owned by a skill.

**Detection**: Compare each reference file's subject with the skill taxonomy table.

**Resolution**: Move any unique content from the reference into the skill, then delete
the duplicate section. If the reference file is empty after removal, delete it and
update `agents.md` Context Loading Rules and References Folder inventory.

---

### Type 2 — Cross-cutting principle buried in a skill

A principle is listed in a skill's `## Agent Behavior` section but applies to all tasks
(not just that domain). Examples: no sycophancy, calibrate uncertainty, lean scope,
never fabricate references.

**Detection**: Read each skill's Agent Behavior section. For each principle, ask:
"Would this make sense in a skill that has nothing to do with this domain?"
If yes, it is cross-cutting.

**Resolution**: Move it to the `Agent Behavior` section of `agents.md`. In the skill, replace the
section with `## Agent Behavior Extensions` listing only domain-specific rules and
a note that the universal principles in `agents.md` apply.

---

### Type 3 — Legacy section in a skill

A skill documents a pattern, library, or architectural decision that has been
refactored or abandoned. Teaching this pattern leads the agent to produce code
that no longer fits the codebase.

**Detection** (requires codebase scan — see §Optional: Codebase Scan): Extract file paths,
class names, and patterns from skill examples. Search the workspace to verify they exist.

**Resolution**: If the old pattern still exists as legacy code, move the description
to a clearly marked `## Legacy Patterns` section with a warning. If the pattern is
completely gone, delete the section.

---

### Type 4 — `agents.md` contains implementation detail

`agents.md` has coding rules, style guidelines, or architectural decisions that belong
in a skill. This inflates the always-loaded context and breaks the routing model.

**Detection**: Read each section of `agents.md`. Flag any content that is domain-specific
(only relevant when doing .NET work, or only when doing React work).

**Resolution**: Move the content into the appropriate skill. Replace with a one-line
pointer if helpful.

---

### Type 5 — Context Loading Rules are stale or ambiguous

A rule in `agents.md §Context Loading Rules` references a file whose content has
changed, a file that no longer exists, or is phrased ambiguously such that a subagent
could not self-load without parent guidance.

**Detection**: For each rule, verify:
- The referenced file exists.
- The file's current content still matches the rule's stated rationale.
- The trigger condition ("for build tasks", "for implementation tasks") is unambiguous.

**Resolution**: Update the rule description to match actual content, or remove the
rule if the file's content is fully covered by a skill.

---

### Type 6 — Skill description does not discriminate well

A skill's `description` frontmatter is too vague to auto-trigger reliably, or it
triggers for tasks that belong to a different skill.

**Detection**: Read the description and ask: "Could a model reading only this description
decide when NOT to use this skill?" If not, it is too broad.

**Resolution**: Rewrite to include specific trigger phrases (Spanish + English),
explicit task types, and explicit exclusions where needed.

---

## Subagent Self-Loading Audit

Run this check as the final step of every audit. The ecosystem is healthy when:

1. **`agents.md` is self-sufficient for orientation.** A subagent reading only
   `agents.md` knows: the project, the guardrails, its own behavioral rules, and what
   to load next for any task type. It does not need the parent to inject additional context.

2. **Context Loading Rules are actionable.** Each rule maps a task type to a file.
   No ambiguity about which rule applies to a given task.

3. **Skills auto-trigger from their description.** A model should select the right
   skill from the description alone, without needing to read the skill body first.

4. **`agents.md` is lean.** If `agents.md` grows beyond ~150 lines of prose (excluding
   the Spec Index table), re-examine whether some content belongs in a reference file
   or skill instead.

Flag any violation as a Type 4 or Type 5 finding and include it in the plan.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Read `agents.md` fully
- [ ] List all `.agents/skills/` and `.agents/references/` files
- [ ] For each `references/` file: does a skill own this domain? → Type 1 if yes
- [ ] For each skill: does `§Agent Behavior` contain cross-cutting principles? → Type 2
- [ ] For each section in `agents.md`: is this implementation detail? → Type 4
- [ ] For each Context Loading Rule: is the file current and the trigger unambiguous? → Type 5
- [ ] For each skill description: does it discriminate well? → Type 6
- [ ] If legacy patterns suspected: run Optional Codebase Scan (Type 3)
- [ ] Run Subagent Self-Loading Audit
- [ ] Draft plan with all findings — **STOP, get approval**
- [ ] Execute approved changes
- [ ] Verify `agents.md` is still self-sufficient after changes

> **Creation mode** — Use the sections below to create a new skill from scratch.

## Creating a New Skill

Use this workflow when a new domain needs a skill and no existing skill can absorb it.

### Step 1 — Confirm the skill is warranted

Before creating, verify against §Knowledge Taxonomy above:

- Does this domain already have a skill? → Add a section to it instead.
- Is the content < ~2 pages with no workflow or examples needed? → Put it in `references/`.
- Is it project-agnostic (not specific to this project)? → Do not create a project skill; reference external docs.

Only proceed if the domain is project-specific, warrants a workflow, has ≥1 concrete example,
and a subagent would fail without it.

**`name` field constraints:**
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no uppercase, no underscores)
- Must not start or end with a hyphen; no consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match the parent directory name exactly
- Max 64 characters

### Step 2 — Design the description (trigger)

The `description` field in YAML frontmatter is the **only** mechanism that triggers a skill.
A model reads the description and decides whether to load the skill.

**Rules for a good description:**

1. **Cover the language(s) your team uses.** Include trigger phrases that match how developers naturally type requests on this project. Include 3–6 natural phrases covering the domain.
   Example: `"create a new endpoint"`, `"add a new module"`, `"implement feature X"`.

1. **Lean toward triggering.** Skills tend to undertrigger — models skip them when they would be useful.
   Write descriptions that lean slightly toward activation rather than being conservative. If the skill
   *might* apply to a request, phrase the description so it covers that case too. An undertriggered
   skill is invisible; a slightly over-triggered skill just gets skimmed and ignored.

1. **Name the domain explicitly.** Say what the skill is for, not just what it does.
   ✅ `"Use for backend API implementation tasks"`
   ❌ `"Use when writing code"`

1. **Include explicit exclusions.** If the skill could be confused with another, say what it is NOT for.
   Example: `"DO NOT USE for React frontend work — use react-frontend-coding instead."`

1. **Add a NEVER clause** for the most critical workflow constraint, if any.
   Example: `"NEVER skip the planning phase."`

1. **Keep it under ~20 lines.** Descriptions that are too long become ambiguous.

### Step 3 — Draft the skill body

Every skill must have the following sections in this order — read `assets/skill-template.md` when drafting.

**Required sections**: Purpose, Workflow (with Phase A STOP gate), Agent Behavior Extensions, Checklist.
**Optional but recommended**: Plan Document Format, Architecture Map / Layer Patterns, Naming Conventions, Domain Glossary.

**Skill folder anatomy** — beyond `SKILL.md`, a skill can bundle:

```
{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code agents can run
├── references/       # Optional: docs loaded on demand
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, static files
```

Reference these from `SKILL.md` with an explicit load condition:
> "Read `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200 status code."
A generic "see references/ for details" is not enough — the agent won't know when to load it.

**Size and progressive disclosure:**
Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material (large tables, full examples,
edge-case docs) to `references/`. The full body loads into context on every activation, so every
line competes for the agent's attention.

Include the `compatibility` field in the frontmatter if the skill requires a specific agent
or toolchain (e.g., `compatibility: Requires Python 3.10+ and access to the internet`).

**Writing principles for the body:**

- **Explain the why.** Instead of `ALWAYS use parameterized queries`, write: "Use parameterized
  queries — string interpolation in SQL is the primary vector for injection attacks." Agents that
  understand the reason behind an instruction make better context-dependent decisions.
- **Add a Gotchas section** for non-obvious, project-specific facts — concrete corrections to
  mistakes the agent would make without being told. Keep it in `SKILL.md` so the agent reads it
  before encountering the situation.
- **Procedures over declarations.** Teach the agent *how to approach a class of problems*, not
  just what to produce for one specific case. The approach should generalize even when individual
  details are specific.
- **Add what the agent lacks; omit what it knows.** Don't explain general concepts the agent
  already understands. Focus on project-specific conventions, non-obvious edge cases, and
  the particular tools or APIs to use.

### Step 4 — Language and terminology conventions

Follow the language and terminology conventions defined in your project's `agents.md`.
If the project has no conventions defined, establish them in `agents.md` before creating skills.

This ensures skill content uses consistent names for domain concepts and matches the
language(s) developers naturally use when writing requests.

### Step 5 — Register the skill

After creating the skill file at `.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`:

1. No manual registration is needed — the VS Code skills system auto-discovers skills from their frontmatter.
2. Update `agents.md §Documentation Maintenance` to mention the new skill if it governs a new category of documentation.
3. If the skill has a corresponding `references/` file that is now superseded, reduce or remove that file
   following Type 1 resolution (move unique content into the skill first).
4. Update `agents.md §Context Loading Rules` if the new skill changes what a subagent should load for a given task type.

---

## Agent Behavior Extensions

The universal agent behavior principles in `agents.md §Agent Behavior` apply to all tasks.
The following rules are specific to documentation maintenance work:

- **Verify before deleting.** Before removing any content, confirm it is fully captured at
  the destination (or is genuinely redundant with no information loss). "Lean scope" does not
  justify silent deletion — maintenance tasks have an asymmetric risk: it is easy to destroy
  institutional knowledge that is hard to reconstruct.

- **Self-application of the standard.** When the task involves modifying a skill, that skill
  must be evaluated with the same audit criteria (Taxonomy, Inconsistency Types, Subagent
  Self-Loading) as any other skill. Do not exempt the file being edited from the audit.

- **Taxonomy-anchored proposals.** Every proposed change must include an explicit taxonomic
  justification — state which category the content belongs to (global, `references/`, or skill)
  and why, referencing the Knowledge Taxonomy. A move without a taxonomy reason is not a
  sufficient proposal.

---

## Optional: Codebase Scan (Type 3 — Legacy Detection)

Run when the user suspects a skill documents code that no longer exists, or after
a significant refactor.

1. Extract from the skill all file paths, class names, method names, and API endpoints
   cited in examples and rules.
2. For each reference, search the workspace:
   - File paths → verify the file exists.
   - Class/method names → grep for the identifier.
   - API endpoints → grep controllers for the route.
3. Flag any missing reference as a potential Type 3 (Legacy) finding.
4. Add findings to the audit plan.

Offer this step explicitly before running — do not run by default.
